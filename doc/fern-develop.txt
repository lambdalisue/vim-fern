INTRODUCTION					*fern-develop-introduction*

This is documentation for |fern.vim| developer.


=============================================================================
FRI						*fern-develop-fri*

Fern Resource Identifier (FRI) is designed to be used in Vim's buffer name and
explained as the following:

  FRI = scheme "://" [ auth ] "/" path [ ";" query ][ "#" fragment ][$]

Where:

  scheme   = ALPHA { ALPHA | DIGIT | "_" }
  auth     = { pchar }
  path     = { segment "/" }
  query    = { pchar | "/" | ";" }
  fragment = { pchar | "/" | ";" }

And the definition of each sub-components are:

  pct-encoded = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG
  reserved = gen-delims | sub-delims
  unreserved = ALPHA | DIGIT | "-" | "."| "_" | "~"
  gen-delims = ":" | "/" | ";" | "#" | "[" | "]" | "@"
  sub-delims = "!" | "$" | "&" | """ | "(" | ")" | "+" | "," | "="
  segment   = pchar { pchar }
  pchar     = { unreserved | pct-encoded | sub-delims | ":" | "@" }

FRI was desigend to remove the following characters which could not be used
in buffer names in Windows from URI definition:

  unusable   = "<" | ">" | "|" | "?" | "*"

Note that "fern" scheme may end with "$" to avoid unwilling filetype plugins.
For example, some filetype plugin add "BufRead *.vim ..." thus if the FRI ends
with ".vim", that autocmd is triggered without "$".

Developers can use the following function to parse/format FRIs.

							*fern#fri#new()*
fern#fri#new({partial})
	Create a FRI instance from {partial} |Dictionary|.
	Note that omitted fields in {partial} is filled with an empty string.

							*fern#fri#parse()*
fern#fri#parse({expr})
	Parse the {expr} (|String|) and return a FRI instance.
	The instance has the following attributes:

	"scheme"	A |String| scheme part
	"authority"	A |String| authority part
	"path"		A |String| path part
	"query"		A |Dict| query part
	"fragment"	A |String| fragment part

	Note that "fern" scheme always end with "$" thus the trailing "$" is
	removed from {expr} if scheme is "fern".

							*fern#fri#format()*
fern#fri#format({fri})
	Format a |String| representation of the {fri} instance.
	Note that "fern" scheme always end with "$" thus the trailing "$" is
	added to the result if scheme is "fern".
>
	echo fern#fri#format({
	      \ 'scheme': 'http',
	      \ 'authority': 'www.example.com',
	      \ 'path': 'foo/bar',
	      \ 'query': {},
	      \ 'fragment': '',
	      \})
	" -> https://www.example.com/foo/bar
<
							*fern#fri#encode()*
fern#fri#encode({str}[, {pattern}])
	Apply percent-encoding to characters which matches the {pattern} in
	the {str}. When the {pattern} is omitted, unusable characters and
	percent character itself in {str} are encoded.
	NOTE:
	The default {pattern} has changed from v1.16.0

							*fern#fri#decode()*
fern#fri#decode({str})
	Decode percent-encoding from the {str}.


=============================================================================
NODE						*fern-develop-node*

A node instance is a tree item which has the following attributes:

"name"		A |String| name of the node. This value is used in "__key"
		thus must be unique among nodes which has same "__owner".

"status"	A |Number| which indicates the node status. One of the
		followings:
		|g:fern#STATUS_NONE|	Leaf node
		|g:fern#STATUS_COLLAPSED|	Branch node (close)
		|g:fern#STATUS_EXPANDED|	Branch node (open)

"label"		A |String| used to display the node in a tree view.

"badge"		A |String| used to display the node badge in a tree view.
		Only first character is used in the default renderer.

"hidden"	A 1/0 to indicate if the node should be hidden. All hidden
		nodes become visible once fern enter hidden mode.

"bufname"	A |String| buffer name used to open the node or |v:null|.
		This value is used when users want to enter a branch node so
		scheme developers SHOULD assign a proper value to this
		attribute. Otherwise users cannot enter the branch node.

"concealed"	A |Dict| used as a namespace object to store complex objects
		which is not suitable to output.
		Developers MUST follow same convention of naming under this
		namespace as well.

"__processing"	A |Number| which indicate that the node is in processing.
		If the value is greater than 0, a spinner is displayed in sign
		area of the node to indicate that the node is processing.

"__key"		A |List| of |String| which represents the location of the
		node in the tree.
		This value is automatically assigned by fern and developers
		should NOT touch unless for debugging purpose.

"__owner"	An owner node instance of the node in the tree.
		This value is automatically assigned by fern and developers
		should NOT touch unless for debugging purpose.

"_{XXX}"	Any attribute starts from a single underscore (_) is opened
		for each scheme. Note that any complex value should be stored
		in "concealed" instead to avoid display error.

*g:fern#STATUS_NONE*
*g:fern#STATUS_COLLAPSED*
*g:fern#STATUS_EXPANDED*
	Constant |Number| which indicates a node status.
	STATUS_NONE means that the node is leaf and does not have any status.
	STATUS_COLLAPSED means that the node is branch and collapsed (closed).
	STATUS_EXPANDED means that the node is branch and expanded (opened).


=============================================================================
MAPPING						*fern-develop-mapping*

Fern provides global mappings under "autoload/fern/mapping" directory.
Mapping MUST provide an init function as "fern#mapping#{name}#init()" with
a boolean argument to disable default mappings.

Mappings under that directory are registered automatically when a filename has
listed in |g:fern#mapping#mappings| variable.

So 3rd party plugin MUST register mappings by add followings to plugin.vim
like:
>
	call add(g:fern#mapping#mappings, ['your_plugin'])
>
*g:fern#mapping#mappings*
	A |List| of globally available mapping names. 
	A target mapping MUST exist under "fern#mapping#" namespace.


=============================================================================
SCHEME						*fern-develop-scheme*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROVIDER				*fern-develop-scheme-provider*

Provider is a core instance to produce scheme plugin. The instance must has
the following methods.

				*fern-develop-scheme-provider.get_root()*
.get_root({url})		
	Return a (partial) node instance of the {url} (|String|).
	The node instance will be used as a root node of a tree.
	It throws error when no node is found for the {url}.

	The node instance MUST have the following attributes.

	"name"		The name of the node (required)
	"status"	1/0 to indicate if the node is branch (required)

	And may have the following attributes.

	"label"		Label to display the node in a tree view
	"hidden"	1/0 to indicate if the node should be hidden
	"bufname"	Buffer name used to open the node or |v:null|
	"concealed"	Namespace for storing complex object
	"_{ANY}"	Scheme specific variables (e.g. "_path" in file)

	The partial node will be filled by fern to become |fern-develop-node|.

				*fern-develop-scheme-provider.get_parent()*
.get_parent({node}, {token})
	Return a promise which is resolved to a parent node of the {node}.
	It resolves the {node} itself when the {node} does not have parent.

	The {token} is CancellationToken which can be used to cancel the
	internal process. Use ... to ignore that argument.

				*fern-develop-scheme-provider.get_children()*
.get_children({node}, {token})
	Return a promise which is resolved to a list of child nodes of the
	{node}. It rejects when the {node} is leaf node.

	The {token} is CancellationToken which can be used to cancel the
	internal process. Use ... to ignore that argument.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAPPING					*fern-develop-scheme-mapping*

Fern provides scheme mappings under "autoload/fern/scheme/{scheme}/mapping"
directory.  Mapping MUST provide an init function as 
"fern#scheme#{scheme}#mapping#{name}#init()" with a boolean argument to disable 
default mappings.

Mappings under that directory are registered automatically when a filename has
listed in |g:fern#scheme#{scheme}#mapping#mappings| variable.

So 3rd party plugin MUST register mappings by add followings to plugin.vim
like:
>
	call add(g:fern#scheme#file#mapping#mappings, ['your_plugin'])
>
*g:fern#scheme#{scheme}#mapping#mappings*
	A |List| of scheme available mapping names for {scheme}.
	A target mapping MUST exist under "fern#scheme#{scheme}#mapping#"
	namespace.


=============================================================================
HOOK						*fern-develop-hook*

Following hook will be emitted by |fern#hook#emit()| from fern itself.

	Called when fern viewer has registered the syntax.
	The {helper} is a helper instance described in |fern-develop-helper|.

"viewer:highlight" ({helper})

	all content has rendererd.
	The {helper} is a helper instance described in |fern-develop-helper|.


=============================================================================
HELPER						*fern-develop-helper*
