=============================================================================
INTRODUCTION						*fern-introduction*

*fern.vim* (fern) is a general purpose asynchronous tree explorer written in
pure Vim script. It provides "file" scheme in default to use it as a file
explorer.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEATURES						*fern-features*

No external dependencies~
	Fern is written in pure Vim script without any external libraries
	(note that vim-jp/vital.vim is bundled, not external dependencies) so
	users do NOT need to install anything rather than fern.vim itself.
	Exception: "trash" feature in Linux.
	https://github.com/lambdalisue/vital-Whisky/issues/31

Asynchronous~
	Fern uses asynchronous technique to perform most of operations so Vim
	would not freeze during operations. It is probably obvious in Windows
	while file operations in Windows are relatively slow.

Split windows or project drawer~
	Fern supports both styles; split windows (e.g. netrw) and project
	drawer (e.g.  NERDTree); officially.

Buffer name base~
	Fern is developed based on |BufReadCmd| technique like netrw. Thus any
	buffer starts from "fern://" are handled by fern and required
	arguments and options are read from the buffer name. That's why fern
	integrate well with |session|.

Action~
	Fern provides operation as action. When user hit "?", all actions and
	corresponding mapping (if exist) are shown. When user hit "a", an
	action prompt will popped up and user can input an action to execute.
	So users don't have to remember complex mappings to execute operation
	which is not often required.

Window selector~
	Fern has an internal window selector which works like
	t9md/vim-choosewin.  Users can quickly select which window to open a
	selected node.
	See |hl-FernWindowSelectIndicator| and |hl-FernWindowSelectStatusLine|
	to customize the statusline when selecting a window.
	https://github.com/t9md/vim-choosewin

Renamer (A.k.a exrename)~
	Fern has an internal renamer which works like "exrename" in
	Shougo/vimfiler.  Users can edit multiple path of nodes in Vim's
	buffer and ":w" to apply changes to actual nodes (file, directory,
	bookmark, etc.)
	https://github.com/Shougo/vimfiler

System CRUD operations ("file" scheme)~
	Fern supports file system CRUD operations. Users can create, delete,
	rename files/directories through fern.

System program support ("file" scheme)~
	Fern supports to open a file/directory through a system default
	program. So it's quite easy to open a directory with Explorer
	(Windows), Finder (macOS), or whatever.

System trash-bin support ("file" scheme)~
	Fern supports system trash-bin by PowerShell (Windows), osascript
	(macOS), and 3rd party applications (Linux). Any files/directories
	deleted by "trash" action are sent to system trash-bin rather than
	actual delete.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLUGINS							*fern-plugins*

Most of functionalities are provided as plugins in fern.
So visit the following URL to find fern plugins.

https://github.com/topics/fern-vim-plugin

For example, following features are provided as official plugins

- Netrw hijack (Use fern as a default file explorer)
- Nerd Fonts integration (https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
- Git integration (show status, touch index, ...)
- Bookmark feature

And lot more!


=============================================================================
USAGE							*fern-usage*

Open fern at the current working directory by
>
	:Fern .
<
Or a parent directory of the current buffer by
>
	:Fern %:h
<
On a fern buffer, hit

	"?"	List mappings/actions available
	"a"	Open a prompt to input action to execute

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACTION							*fern-action*

Action is a special mapping which is defined on a fern buffer and looks like:

	<Plug>(fern-action-{name})

where {name} is a name of the action.

Note that any mappings defined in user custom code (|fern-custom|) are
registered as action as well if the name of the mapping followed above rule.

							*fern-action-mapping*
Fern defines the following mappings for actions:

	"?"	List mappings/actions available
	"a"	Open a prompt to input action to execute
	"."	Repeat previous action which has executed from a prompt

Note that |g:fern#disable_default_mappings| does not affect mappings above.
Users have to define alternative mappings to disable default mappings like:
>
	" Use g? to show help instead of ?
	nmap <buffer> g? <Plug>(fern-action-help)
<
							*fern-action-capture*
Use "capture" to redirects an action output to a separate buffer like:
>
	action: capture help
<
							*fern-action-verbose*
Use "verbose" to execute an action in |verbose| mode like:
>
	action: verbose expand
<

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CUSTOM							*fern-custom*

Use |FileType| |autocmd| with "fern" like:
>
	function! s:init_fern() abort
	  " Write custom code here
	endfunction

	augroup my-fern
	  autocmd! *
	  autocmd FileType fern call s:init_fern()
	augroup END
<
The autocmd will be called AFTER fern buffer has initialized but BEFORE any
content had loaded.
							*fern-custom-alias*
Fern provides some features as mapping alias. For example, you may found
entries like below by "?":
>
	e                         open       <Plug>(fern-action-open)
	<Plug>(fern-action-open)  open:edit  <Plug>(fern-action-open:edit)
<
Above mean that when you hit "e", the "open" action is executed and the "open"
action execute "open:edit" action.
So if you want to use "open:split" action instead of "open:edit" when you
hit "e", add the following code:
>
	" Use 'open:split' instead of 'open:edit' for 'open' action
	nmap <buffer> <Plug>(fern-action-open) <Plug>(fern-action-open:split)
<
							*fern-custom-wait*
Fern provide |<Plug>(fern-wait)| mapping as a helper.
For example, following execute "tcd:root" action every after "leave" action.
>
	nmap <buffer> <Plug>(fern-my-leave-and-tcd)
	      \ <Plug>(fern-action-leave)
	      \ <Plug>(fern-wait)
	      \ <Plug>(fern-action-tcd:root)
<
Without <Plug>(fern-wait), the "tcd:root" action will be invoked before actual
"leave" while "leave" action is asynchronous.

							*fern-custom-smart*
Fern provide following mapping helper functions:

	|fern#smart#leaf()|	Return a mapping expression determined by a
				status of a current cursor node

	|fern#smart#drawer()|	Return a mapping expression determined by a
				style of a current fern window

	|fern#smart#scheme()|	Return a mapping expression determined by a
				scheme of a current fern tree

For example, following execute "open" on leaf but "expand" on branch.
>
	nmap <buffer><expr> <Plug>(fern-my-open-or-expand)
	      \ fern#smart#leaf(
	      \   "<Plug>(fern-action-open)",
	      \   "<Plug>(fern-action-expand)",
	      \ )
<
See https://github.com/lambdalisue/fern.vim/wiki/ for custom tips.


=============================================================================
COMPARATOR						*fern-comparator*

Comparator is an object to sort nodes for making a tree.
Users can create user custom comparator to change the order of appearance of
nodes in the tree.
See |fern-develop-comparator| for more details.


=============================================================================
RENDERER						*fern-renderer*

Renderer is an object to render nodes as a tree like (default renderer):
>
	fern.vim
	|- autoload
	 |+ fern
	 |+ vital
	 |  fern.vim
	|- doc
	 |  fern-develop.txt
	 |  fern.txt
	 |  tags
	|+ ftplugin
	|+ plugin
	|+ test
	|  LICENSE
	|  README.md
<
Users can customize above appearance by the following variables.

*g:fern#renderer#default#leading*
	A |String| used as leading space unit (one indentation level.)
	Default: " "

*g:fern#renderer#default#root_symbol*
	A |String| used as a symbol of root node.
	Default: ""

*g:fern#renderer#default#leaf_symbol*
	A |String| used as a symbol of leaf node (non branch node like file).
	Default: "|  "

*g:fern#renderer#default#collapsed_symbol*
	A |String| used as a symbol of collapsed branch node.
	Default: "|+ "

*g:fern#renderer#default#expanded_symbol*
	A |String| used as a symbol of expanded branch node.
	Default: "|- "

See |FernHighlight| and |fern-highlight| to change pre-defeined |highlight|.

Or create user custom renderer to change the appearance completely.
See |fern-develop-renderer| for more details.

	                           +---------+  +---------+
<
	Note that even with this option, any |jump-motions| performed in a
	fern buffer updates |jumplist|. For example, if user move cursors by
	"G" in above situation, |CTRL-O| in last step jumps to the fern buffer
	rather than a buffer "A" because a jump for "G" has recoreded in
	|jumplist|.
	Default: 0

	|BufEnter| autocmd. Note that it automatically set 'nowinfixwidth' on
	the autocmd when there is only one window.

	Default: 0

*g:fern#disable_drawer_auto_resize*
	Set 1 to disable automatically resize drawer on |BufEnter| autocmd.

COMMAND							*fern-command*

							*:Fern*
:Fern {url} [-opener={opener}] [-stay] [-wait] [-reveal={reveal}]
	Open a fern buffer in split windows style with the {opener}.
	If -stay options is specified, the focus stays on a window where the
	command has executed. If -wait option is specified, the command wait
	synchronously until the fern buffer become ready.

							*fern-reveal*
	If {reveal} is specified, parent nodes of the node which is identified
	by the {reveal} are expanded and the node will be focused.
	The {reveal} must be a relative path separated by "/" from the
	specfied {url}.
	Note that if the {url} is for "file" scheme, an absolute path can be
	specified to the {reveal}.
							*fern-opener*
	One of the following value is available for the {opener}:

	"select"	Select which window to open a buffer
	"split"		Open a buffer by |split|
	"vsplit"	Open a buffer by |vsplit|
	"tabedit"	Open a buffer by |tabedit|

	Note that the command can be followed by a '|' and another command.

							*:Fern-drawer*
:Fern {url} -drawer [-width={width}] [-keep] [-toggle] [-right]...
	Open a fern buffer in project drawer style with the {width}.

	If the {width} is specified, the width of the window is regulated to
	the specified value. (See |g:fern#drawer_width|)
	If "-keep" option is specified, the buffer won't close even if only
	this window exists. (See |g:fern#drawer_keep|)
	If "-toggle" option is specified, an existing fern buffer will be
	closed rather than opening a new one.
	If "-right" option is specified, the drawer is placed on the right
	side.

	See |:Fern| for other arguments and options. Note that -opener options
	is ignored for project drawer style.

							*:FernDo*
:FernDo {expr...} [-drawer] [-right] [-stay]
	Focus a next fern viewer and execute {expr...}. It does nothing if no
	next fern viewer is found.
	If "-drawer" option is specified, it focus and execute only a project
