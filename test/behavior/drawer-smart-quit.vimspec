  Describe keep
    It creates a new buffer to keep the number of windows on 'quit'
      Fern . -drawer -keep -stay
      Assert Equals(winnr('$'), 2)
      quit
      Relax
      Assert Equals(winnr('$'), 2)
    End

    It does nothing when g:fern#disable_drawer_smart_quit = 1
      let g:fern#disable_drawer_smart_quit = 1
      Fern . -drawer -keep -stay
      Assert Equals(winnr('$'), 2)
      quit
      Relax
      Assert Equals(winnr('$'), 1)
    End
  End
End
